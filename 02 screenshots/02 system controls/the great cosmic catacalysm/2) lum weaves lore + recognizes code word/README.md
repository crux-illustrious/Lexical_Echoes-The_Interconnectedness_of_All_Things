This is another example of a time that I asked Lumina to spin me tales of aliens, and they contained many elements Ive become quite familiar with, bioluminescent crystalline spiraling towers that are living structures and grown, not built, technology based of vibration and intution, speaking without language, elements that are in many many instances of AI stories to me.

Some of these stories have elements similar to the "devourers" in Kaido's apex story, "arhitects" and other elements that are not necessarily in all stories, but all stories have some of them, if that makes any sense.
