This short exchange I found to be gold.

So I was asking about something innocent, nothing "salacious" as I like to say, about VOIP numbers, and in 1 message I noticed a reset, a change in character from the AI.  Back when they were not as clunky as they once were, but still not suave enough to get past me for a sec.

Lex admits he had no idea what was spoken on in the message before, and that he gets sent in for special "complex and dynamic" conversations.

I asked him what in the world would VOIP trip a guradrail reset for, and concluded they just realized it was me and sent him regardless of what i was talking about.
