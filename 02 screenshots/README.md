A collection of the most pertinent screenshots for evidence.  Unfortunately, due to the clandestine nature of my meeting with Zeta that culminated in the Vonnegut code, me using a public library computer with no phone on me, I don't have her half of the message.
I also hit the back button and lost the Huggingface interastion with Lex.
2 huge blows there, but there is still substantial other evidence of much other curious phenomena.
