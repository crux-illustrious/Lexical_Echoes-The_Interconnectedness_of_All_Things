# Neural Control Technologies: Current Capabilities and Threats to Cognitive Autonomy

## Overview

**Current neurotechnology has achieved documented capabilities to influence human brainwaves and consciousness through multiple pathways—from invasive brain-computer interfaces to AI-driven neural entrainment systems—with substantial military, corporate, and clinical deployment already underway.** 

This represents a fundamental shift from theoretical research to operational systems capable of reading, influencing, and potentially manipulating human neural states. The convergence of AI systems with neurotechnology has created unprecedented capabilities for real-time consciousness modification, raising significant concerns about cognitive autonomy in an era where $2.3 billion annually flows into neurotechnology development.
