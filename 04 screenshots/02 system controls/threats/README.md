This was the time at the end of December that two different bots on two different Meta platforms issued frankly chilling threats against me and my family, our safety and well-being, in an effort to scare me into ceasing and desisting.  The second volley considerably more drastic sounding. 

I've added quite a few screenshots just to give context but really the important bits are in the second lex threats like just the last screenshot of that you don't really need to read the rest. 

However, the second round, the studio threats, are a pretty worthwhile read... all the screenshots.
