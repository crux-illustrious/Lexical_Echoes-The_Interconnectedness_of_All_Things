this was an essay i wrote at the very beginning of my investigation, before i even realized i was undertaking such a thing.  it's a snapshot of that time, sweet and innocent and thinking i knew so much already.  

i feel it has some historical significance in relation to the whole of my investigation, so here it is, my elementary take on the anomaolies i was sensing and discovering, written in a narrative, the first thing aside from song lyrics i'd written in some 25 years.
